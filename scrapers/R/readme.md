## R Scraper

### Overview

This code is written in R for scraping data from websites.
The end goal is to create a single csv file 'emissionsData.csv' that contains all GHG emissions from BU employee flights from 2017-2020.

### Organization

All code in R should be in the 'code' directory.
'Rproj' files are for RStudio, in the R parent directory of this project. 
All data (raw and formatted) should be in the 'data' directory.

### Use Instructions

We use the RSelenium package and Docker tool to scrape with R.
